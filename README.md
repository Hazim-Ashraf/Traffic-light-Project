# Traffic Light Project
This project involves the design and implementation of a traffic light control system using embedded systems and microcontroller technology. The primary objective is to simulate and manage the operation of traffic lights at intersections efficiently.

Project Components:
Embedded Systems: Utilizing microcontrollers such as ATMEGA32 or STM32 to control the traffic light sequences.

Programming Languages: Implementing the control logic using embedded C to manage the timing and operation of traffic lights based on predefined patterns.
Implementation Steps:
System Design: Planning the control logic, timing sequences, and sensor integration based on traffic flow analysis and intersection requirements.

Hardware Integration: Connecting microcontrollers, sensors, and LED indicators to simulate traffic light behaviors accurately.

Software Development: Writing embedded C code to program the microcontroller for precise control of traffic light timings and sequences.

Testing and Validation: Conducting extensive testing to validate the system's performance under various traffic scenarios, ensuring reliability and accuracy.
